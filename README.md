# Python Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs written as part of my coding practice.  
These programs helped me improve my understanding of programming fundamentals like:

- Loops and Conditions
- String Operations
- Lists and Functions
- Simple Math and Logic Problems
- File Handling (if any)

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each file is a small program solving a specific task.  
For example:
- palindrome.py – Checks if a string is a palindrome
- multiplication_table.py – Prints the multiplication table
- prime_check.py – Checks if a number is prime

## 💡 Purpose

These programs are meant to:
- Strengthen basic Python skills
- Practice syntax, logic, and structure
- Build confidence before starting larger projects
